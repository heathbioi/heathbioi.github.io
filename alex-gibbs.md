Hello everyone, I'm Alex and my job is to help you get the most out of your data!

Have you got a list of genes and would like to find out more about them, such as what pathways etc they are involved in, but don't know where to start?
Take a look at my [what to do with your gene list](what-to-do-with-a-gene-list.md) page!

Looking to find and/or explore cancer data but don't really know where to start? Take a look at my [cancer research resources](cancer-research-resources.md) page!

I have also compiled a list of [general bioinformatics resources](https://heathbioi.github.io/general-bioinformatics-resources/) that may be of use.

Here's a list of things that I can help you with. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, if you would like help with anything not listed here, please contact me **(GibbsA@cardiff.ac.uk)**:

- Download and analyse public data.
- Find information on your favourite gene(s).
- Learn how to use R/Python/Linux.

- Show you how to use softwares/apps.
- Help you create publication-quality images.
